Hi! 

This is a super simple script - just feed it a spreadsheet file, it will read it and spit out tasks which are overdue or due today.

I have included a sample tasks spreadsheet file. Edit to suit your needs. You can add or remove worksheets in the file but if you do this youll have to edit
You can add or remove worksheets in the file but if you do this once you have run the script youll have to save new settings.


SETUP:

Run the included "setup.bat" file, this will handle (almost) everything with the following options. 

Option 1 - Full setup:
It will fetch and prompt you to install Python 3.10
It will then run a python script to test for and install all the associated python modules needed.
It will then ask if you wish to run the task monitor python file at windows startup - up to you whether you do this.
It will then ask if you wish to run the script straight away - this is recommended to setup all the settings.

Option 2 - Python Setup:
It will fetch and prompt you to install Python 3.10
It will then run a python script to test for and install all the associated python modules needed.

Option 3 - Python module setup only:
It will only run the python script to test for and install all the associated python modules needed. (recommended for if there are any issues with modules)

Option 4 - Activate script on Windows Startup:
This runs only the short script to put a registry entry to your python file.

Option 5 - Remove script from Windows Startup:
This is an undo for option 4.

Option 6 - Edit script settings:
If you have already run the script and created settings but now you want to edit them.
